XAI is essential for building trust, ensuring fairness, detecting biases, and meeting regulatory requirements—especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice.\",\n",
        "    \"XAI methods can be categorized as intrinsic (models that are inherently interpretable, such as decision trees or linear models) or post-hoc (techniques applied to complex models after training). Post-hoc techniques include SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), saliency maps, and counterfactual explanations.\",\n",

        "    # Reinforcement Learning / Deep Reinforcement Learning\n",
        "\"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning paradigm where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled input/output pairs—instead, it relies on feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines RL with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling learning directly from raw inputs like images.\",\n",
        "\"The architecture of RL involves key components: the agent (decision-maker), the environment (where it operates), states (observations), actions, rewards, and a policy (strategy). Deep RL architectures include Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which approximate Q-values using CNNs; Policy Gradient methods that directly optimize the policy; and Actor-Critic models which combine value-based and policy-based approaches. Training involves techniques like Q-learning, REINFORCE, and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C).\",\n",
        "\"RL/DRL is used in a wide range of applications such as game playing (e.g., AlphaGo, OpenAI Five), robotics (manipulation and navigation), recommendation systems, industrial control, autonomous vehicles, and finance. It enables autonomous systems to improve through experience, but faces challenges like sample inefficiency, exploration-exploitation trade-off, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and reward shaping.\"\n",

They consist of layers of artificial neurons organized into an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron processes input data and passes the information forward through weighted connections and non-linear activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid. Neural networks are trained using supervised learning techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize a loss function. These models are powerful for recognizing patterns and approximating complex non-linear functions.\n"
